![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/989fa7e2-a70b-4a61-b1fe-07bc85b4fb74)

This plugin provides an intuitive interface to calculate real-world body dimensions from a single image by leveraging a height reference. It allows users to upload a full-body photo, mark reference points, and draw lines corresponding to various body parts. Once the user's height is known, it automatically calculates other measurements in centimeters or inches.

### Features

- **Height-anchored scaling**: Start with a height reference to calibrate the scale from pixels to real-world units.
- **Interactive line drawing**: Click on the image to draw lines representing body parts like shoulder width, torso length, arms, legs, and inseam.
- **Ruler overlays**: Add draggable horizontal rulers to assist with visual alignment.
- **Live measurement summary**: See calculated measurements updated in real time, with copy-to-clipboard functionality.
- **Reset controls**: Buttons to reset rulers or clear all data and start over.
