**Text Tokenizer** is a web-based tool designed to analyze any input text and display detailed metrics including word count, character count, and token count (using OpenAI‚Äôs `cl100k_base` tokenizer). Users can also strip HTML tags from their input and optionally split the text into smaller, token-limited chunks for better readability or model handling. It's a perfect utility for developers, writers, and AI prompt engineers needing precise text insights.
