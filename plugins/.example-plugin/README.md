# Plugin Template

This project is a demonstration of a simple yet flexible web interface template featuring a sidebar for user inputs and a main canvas for displaying dynamic content. It includes all essential metadata, style links, and script files. The goal is to serve as a starting point for building more advanced dashboards or web applications.

## Features

- **Metadata Section:** Contains complete metadata fields used for plugin integrations, including title, plugin-category, plugin-name, plugin-description, and plugin-version.

- **Sidebar:** Designed for all user inputs, featuring input fields, dropdowns, and action buttons. This section is dedicated to collecting data from the user.

- **Canvas (Main Content Area):**  
  A dynamic content area that:

  - Greets the user with a welcome message.
  - Provides various content options (e.g., Analytics View, Data Table).
  - Displays detailed instructions on how to use the dashboard.
  - Outlines extra features for enhancing the user experience.

- **Styles and Scripts:** Integrated with external CSS frameworks and JavaScript libraries such as Flowbite and Font Awesome, along with custom CSS and JavaScript.

### Customization

- **Metadata:** Edit the metadata in the `<head>` section of `index.html` to suit your project's details.
