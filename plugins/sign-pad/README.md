**Sign Pad** is a lightweight, interactive web-based tool for drawing and animating signatures or sketches. It features a canvas-based signature pad with the ability to export drawings in various formats—including static PNGs, SVGs, animated SVGs, and video. Ideal for digital signing, drawing, or handwriting animations.

### How to use?

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a modern browser.
2. Use the sidebar controls to:

   - Draw on the canvas using the selected stroke color and width.
   - Upload a background image if needed.
   - Play the animation of your drawing.

### Special Requirements

- **Modern Browser Support**: The app uses HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript features like `MediaRecorder`, so it requires a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- **Optional**: Internet connection to fetch external libraries like Flowbite and FontAwesome.
