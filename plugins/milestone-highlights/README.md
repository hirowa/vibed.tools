**Milestone Highlighter** is a browser-based tool that helps users identify special milestone anniversaries, where a recurring interval of days aligns with a calendar month, based on a chosen start date. Ideal for tracking recurring events like workouts, sobriety anniversaries, or journaling streaks, this plugin highlights specific monthly anniversaries and lets users export them as calendar events.

### Features

- **Milestone Alignment Detection**: Identifies dates where a specific day-based interval (e.g., every 100 days) aligns with a calendar month from a given anniversary date.
- **Custom Evaluation Range**: Users can define how many years into the future to search for aligned milestones.
- **Calendar Export**: Matched milestones can be exported as a downloadable `.ics` file compatible with calendar apps.
- **Responsive UI with Date Picker**: Includes an intuitive UI with modern design and a datepicker for easy input.
- **Progress Tracking**: Clearly shows how many days and months have passed for each matched milestone.
